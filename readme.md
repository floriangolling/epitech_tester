# Epitest Setup and Usage Guide

## Prerequisites

Before setting up `epitest`, ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed, please follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

## Setup

To set up `epitest`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository containing the `epitest` script and `setup.sh`.

2. **Run the Setup Script**: Execute the `setup.sh` script to install `epitest` on your system. This script must be run with root privileges.

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

   **What `setup.sh` Does**:
   - Checks if the script is run as root or with `sudo`.
   - Verifies the presence of the `epitest` script in the current directory.
   - Copies the `epitest` script to `/usr/local/bin/` for global access.
   - Sets execute permissions on the `epitest` script.

3. **Verify Installation**: After running the setup script, you should see a confirmation message indicating that `epitest` has been successfully installed.

## Usage

To use `epitest`, simply run the following command:

```bash
epitest <command>
```

Replace `<command>` with the command you wish to execute within the Docker environment. For example, to run an executable named `a.out`, use:

```bash
epitest ./a.out
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall `epitest`, remove the script from `/usr/local/bin/`:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/epitest
```

Additionally, you may want to delete the `epitest` script from your current directory.
